title: Customize User Interface
---

Ory Kratos is an HTTP API server and does not include a traditional HTML user
interface (rendering forms such as "Login" or "Registration") in its code base.
We provide several reference UI implementations which you can use to get started
quickly, or which you can use as the basis for your own UI screens:

- The [Ory Cloud Managed UI](https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/ui/welcome)
  is available when you run Ory Kratos in Ory Cloud.
- [React Native Reference Implementation](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native)
- [NodeJS Reference Implementation](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node)
- [React / SPA Reference Implementation](https://github.com/ory/react-nextjs-example)

Ory Kratos' HTTP APIs make it easy and straight forward to write your own UI
(e.g. "login" screen, "update profile settings", ...) in any programming
languages and framework! It can be built in any programming language including
Java, Node, or Python and can be run both a server or an end-user device for
example a browser, or a mobile phone. Implementing your own UI is simple and
straight forward. There is no complex authentication mechanism required and no
need to worry about possible attack vectors such as CSRF or Session Attacks
since Ory Kratos provides the preventive measures built in.

Chapter [Self-Service Flows](../self-service.mdx) contains further information
on APIs and flows related to the SSUI, and build self-service applications.

## UI APIs

To make UI customization easy, Ory Kratos prepares all the necessary data for
forms that need to be shown during e.g. login, registration:

```json5
{
  id: '9b527900-2199-4221-9252-7971b3362282',
  type: 'browser',
  expires_at: '2021-04-28T13:55:36.046466067Z',
  issued_at: '2021-04-28T12:55:36.046466067Z',
  ui: {
    action: 'https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/settings?flow=9b527900-2199-4221-9252-7971b3362282',
    method: 'POST',
    nodes: [
      {
        type: 'input',
        group: 'default',
        attributes: {
          node_type: 'input',
          name: 'csrf_token',
          type: 'hidden',
          value: 'U3r/lgEfT8rA1Lg0Eeo06oGO8mX6T4TKoe/z7rbInhvYeacbRg0IW9zrqnpU1wmQJXKiekNzdLnypx5naHXoPg==',
          required: true,
          disabled: false
        },
        messages: null,
        meta: {}
      },
      {
        type: 'input',
        group: 'profile',
        attributes: {
          node_type: 'input',
          name: 'traits.email',
          type: 'email',
          value: 'foo@ory.sh',
          disabled: false
        },
        messages: null,
        meta: {
          label: {
            id: 1070002,
            text: 'E-Mail',
            type: 'info'
          }
        }
      }
      // ...
    ]
  }
}
```

The above example would be rendered in HTML like this:

```html
<form
  method="POST"
  action="https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/settings?flow=9b527900-2199-4221-9252-7971b3362282"
>
  <!-- this is the first node -->
  <input
    type="hidden"
    name="csrf_token"
    value="U3r/lgEfT8rA1Lg0Eeo06oGO8mX6T4TKoe/z7rbInhvYeacbRg0IW9zrqnpU1wmQJXKiekNzdLnypx5naHXoPg=="
    required
  />

  <!-- this is the second node -->
  <input type="email" name="traits.email" value="foo@ory.sh" />
  <label for="traits.email">E-Mail</label>
</form>
```

As you can see, the JSON can be mapped almost 1:1 to HTML! This method makes it
easy for you to implement complex forms without having to deal with state
management, form validation, and more!

### UI Node Groups

Nodes are grouped (using the `group` key) based on the source that generated the
node. Sources are the different methods such as "password" ("Sign in/up with ID
& password"), "oidc" (Social Sign In), "link" (Password reset and email
verification), "profile" ("Update your profile") and the "default" group which
typically contains the CSRF token.

You can use the node group to filter out items, re-arrange them, render them
differently - up to you!

### UI Node Types

UI Nodes can have several types!

#### UI Text Nodes

#### UI Script Nodes

#### UI Anchor Nodes

#### UI Image Nodes

#### UI Input Nodes

The first node type is the `input` type:

```json
{
  "type": "input",
  "group": "default",
  "attributes": {
    "name": "csrf_token",
    "type": "hidden",
    "node_type": "input",
    "value": "U3r/lgEfT8rA1Lg0Eeo06oGO8mX6T4TKoe/z7rbInhvYeacbRg0IW9zrqnpU1wmQJXKiekNzdLnypx5naHXoPg==",
    "required": true,
    "disabled": false
  },
  "messages": null,
  "meta": {}
}
```

It contains different attributes which you can map 1:1 to an HTML form:

```html
<input
  type="hidden"
  name="csrf_token"
  value="U3r/lgEfT8rA1Lg0Eeo06oGO8mX6T4TKoe/z7rbInhvYeacbRg0IW9zrqnpU1wmQJXKiekNzdLnypx5naHXoPg=="
  required
/>
```

Similarly, other form input types can be sent:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "input",
    "group": "profile",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "traits.email",
      "type": "email",
      "value": "foo@ory.sh",
      "disabled": false
    },
    "messages": null,
    "meta": {
      "label": {
        "id": 1070002,
        "text": "E-Mail",
        "type": "info"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "input",
    "group": "profile",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "method",
      "type": "submit",
      "value": "profile",
      "disabled": false
    },
    "messages": null,
    "meta": {
      "label": {
        "id": 1070003,
        "text": "Save",
        "type": "info"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

As you can see, some fields even include `meta.label` information which you can
use for the labels:

```html
<fieldset>
  <input type="email" name="traits.email" value="foo@ory.sh" />
  <span>E-Mail</span>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
  <input type="submit" name="method" value="profile" />
  <span>Save</span>
</fieldset>
```

### Node Order and Labels

For all traits, the labels and orders are taken from the Identity Schema. An
Identity Schema such as

```json
{
  "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "title": "E-Mail",
          "minLength": 3,
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "website": {
          "title": "Website",
          "type": "string",
          "format": "uri",
          "minLength": 10
        },
        "consent": {
          "title": "Consent",
          "const": true
        },
        "newsletter": {
          "title": "Newsletter",
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      },
      "required": ["email", "website"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

will generate the following fields - take note that the order of the JSON Schema
affects the order of the nodes:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "input",
    "group": "profile",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "traits.email",
      "type": "email",
      "value": "foo@ory.sh",
      "disabled": false
    },
    "messages": null,
    "meta": {
      "label": {
        "id": 1070002,
        "text": "E-Mail",
        "type": "info"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "input",
    "group": "profile",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "traits.name.first",
      "type": "text",
      "value": "Foo",
      "disabled": false
    },
    "messages": null,
    "meta": {
      "label": {
        "id": 1070002,
        "text": "First Name",
        "type": "info"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "input",
    "group": "profile",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "traits.name.last",
      "type": "text",
      "value": "Bar",
      "disabled": false
    },
    "messages": null,
    "meta": {
      "label": {
        "id": 1070002,
        "text": "Last Name",
        "type": "info"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "input",
    "group": "profile",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "method",
      "type": "submit",
      "value": "profile",
      "disabled": false
    },
    "messages": null,
    "meta": {
      "label": {
        "id": 1070003,
        "text": "Save",
        "type": "info"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Generally, submit buttons are the last node in a group. If you wish to have more
flexibility with regards to order or labeling the best option is to implement
this in your UI using map, filter, and other JSON transformation functions.

### Titles, Labels & Validation Messages

Ory Kratos helps users understand what is happening by providing messages that
explain what went wrong or what needs to be done. Examples are "The provided
credentials are invalid", "Missing property email" and similar.

Typically login, registration, settings, ... flows include such messages on
different levels:

1. At the root level, indicating that the message affects the whole request
   (e.g. request expired)
2. At the method (password, oidc, profile) level, indicating that the message
   affects a specific method / form.
3. At the field level, indicating that the message affects a form field (e.g.
   validation errors).

Each message has a layout of:

```json5
{
  id: 1234,
  // This ID will not change and can be used to translate the message or use your own message content.
  text: 'Some default text',
  // A default text in english that you can display if you do not want to customize the message.
  context: {}
  // A JSON object which may contain additional fields such as `expires_at`. This is helpful if you want to craft your own messages.
}
```

The message ID is a 7-digit number (`xyyzzzz`) where

- `x` is the message type which is either `1` for an info message (e.g.
  `1020000`), `4` (e.g. `4020000`) for an input validation error message, and
  `5` (e.g. `5020000`) for a generic error message.
- `yy` is the module or flow this error references and can be:
- `01` for login messages (e.g. `1010000`)
- `02` for logout messages (e.g. `1020000`)
- `03` for multi-factor authentication messages (e.g. `1030000`)
- `04` for registration messages (e.g. `1040000`)
- `05` for settings messages (e.g. `1050000`)
- `06` for account recovery messages (e.g. `1060000`)
- `07` for email/phone verification messages (e.g. `1070000`)
- `zzzz` is the message ID and typically starts at `0001`. For example, message
  ID `4070001` (`4` for input validation error, `07` for verification, `0001`
  for the concrete message) is:
  `The verification code has expired or was otherwise invalid. Please request another code.`.

#### UI Message Codes

UI Messages are always presented as the following JSON

```json5
{
  id: 1234, // A unique, fixed number
  text: '...',
  type: '...', // Usually "error" or "info"
  context: {
    // Additional, contextual information
  }
}
```
